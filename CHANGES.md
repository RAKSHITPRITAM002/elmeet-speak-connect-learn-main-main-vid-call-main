- For Stripe: Creates a form that submits to Stripe's checkout page with proper parameters
- For PayPal: Creates a form that submits to PayPal's checkout page with proper parameters

- Added success and cancel URLs that redirect back to the profile page

### Subscription History
- Shows a timeline of all subscriptions
- Displays payment methods used
- Shows receipts and invoices
- Provides clear status indicators

## 5. Next Steps

2. Implement the backend webhook handlers to process payment confirmations
3. Connect the frontend to your actual API endpoints
4. Implement proper error handling for payment failures
5. Add email notifications for subscription changes
